# TopMovies

 TopMovies is a C# web application that was created to share my favourite movies and Tv shows so that people can stop wasting time trying to decide what to watch 
 TopMovies uses a ASP.NET Core framework with a MVC architecture, an Entity Framework for interacting with the MSSQL Server database, a REST API for making calls to the database and C# Razor pages for the views.
